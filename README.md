# project_ventoux
Welcome to the code repository home of Project Venutoux. 

Each folder is a distinct piece of work I wish to demostrate. The folder just houses the code and supporting files. 

More specific details about the work can be found at [uwsthoughts.com/works](https://www.uwsthoughts.com/works/). Each folder has a README with a link out to more information.

Questions? HMU at hello@uwsthoughts.com
