# project_ventoux
Welcome to the code repository home of Project Venutoux. 

Each folder is a distinct piece of work I wish to demostrate. The folder just houses the code and supporting files. 

More specific details about the work can be found at [uwsthoughts.com/works](https://www.uwsthoughts.com/works/). Each folder has a README with a link out to more information.

The work is made available under the creative commons non-commercial use license. At various points in my work, I'm using, referencing, or building upon work governed by this license and this keeps everything easy.

Questions? HMU at hello@uwsthoughts.com
